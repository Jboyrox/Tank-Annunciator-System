# Tank-Annunciator-System
A maple syrup factory in Vermont has a problem. They have a holding tank that stores their
product that overflows from time-to-time. When this happens, an operator in a remote monitoring room
is sent to clean up the mess. They have asked you group to implement an “Annunciator” system to
monitor the holding tank and report its status to the operator in the monitoring room. The system has
two objectives, to notify the operator when the tank is near full (so they can manually turn off the fill
valve), then to notify the operator when the tank has over flown (so they can be sent to clean it up).
